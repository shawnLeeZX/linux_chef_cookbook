# This configuration file binds many vi- and vim-like bindings to the
# appropriate tmux key bindings.  Note that for many key bindings there is no
# tmux analogue.  This is intended for tmux 1.3, which handles pane selection
# differently from the previous versions

# Set the prefix to ^A.
set-option -g prefix C-a
unbind-key C-b
bind-key C-a send-prefix

# Create new windows in the same dir
bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# split windows like vim
# vim's definition of a horizontal/vertical split is reversed from tmux's
bind s split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"
bind v split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"

# move around panes with hjkl, as one would in vim after pressing ctrl-w
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# resize panes like vim
# feel free to change the "1" to however many lines you want to resize by, only
# one at a time can be slow
bind < resize-pane -L 5
bind > resize-pane -R 5
bind - resize-pane -D 5
bind + resize-pane -U 5

# bind : to command-prompt like vim
# this is the default in tmux already
bind : command-prompt

# vi-style controls for copy mode
# For above v2.3
setw -g mode-keys vi
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'v' send -X begin-selection
bind-key -T copy-mode-vi 'y' send -X copy-selection-and-cancel
# For v2.3 and below
# bind-key -t vi-copy 'v' begin-selection
# bind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-selection

# Change delay time for emacs.
set -sg escape-time 0

# Set default shell to fish
set-option -g default-shell /usr/bin/fish
